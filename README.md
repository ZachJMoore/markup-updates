# MarkUp Updates

A public home for all MarkUp information, updates, documentation, and releases.

## What is MarkUp?

MarkUp is a standalone application that allows you to quickly and easily draw over anything on your screen. You can use it for things like: 1) annotating before taking screenshots. 2) guiding others while giving a presentation or screen sharing. 3) or using whiteboard mode to make quick sketches when brainstorming.

It simply runs in the background, and when your ready, click the pencil icon to start drawing wherever you are at.
